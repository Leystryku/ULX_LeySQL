# ULX_LeySQL
 Extends the ULX library, allowing you to have a website with all your ULX related information. The lua parts gives ULX MySQL capabilities, the Webdev part allows you to view the data etc. ULX is a Addon for Garry's Mod servers allowing administrators to manage their servers. This script itself is from ~end of 2016~ beginning 2017 so compability with newest ULX version not guaranteed.
